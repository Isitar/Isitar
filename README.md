### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Swiss software engineer. Feel free to look around, the most interesting projects are pinned.

This is my private Github account where I store most of my personal projects. In my working life I mainly deal with .NET and VUE.JS. I also work with docker and k8s. I love working with .NET so most of my projects are done with it.
